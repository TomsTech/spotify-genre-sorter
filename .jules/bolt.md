## 2024-05-04 - [Debouncing Search Input]
**Learning:** The frontend filters the genre list synchronously on every keystroke (`oninput="filterAndRenderGenres(this.value)"`), which can cause main thread blocking and jank when dealing with hundreds or thousands of genres.
**Action:** Implement debouncing for search input handlers to delay the filtering logic until the user pauses typing. This is a classic frontend performance optimization that is simple to add and measurably improves responsiveness.
## 2024-05-07 - [Debouncing Template Inputs]
**Learning:** The frontend updates playlist and description templates synchronously on every keystroke (`oninput="updatePlaylistTemplate(this.value)"`), which causes main thread blocking and unnecessary localStorage writes.
**Action:** Implement debouncing for template input handlers to delay the updates until the user pauses typing. This is a classic frontend performance optimization that prevents jank and excessive IO operations.
