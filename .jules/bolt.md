## 2024-05-04 - [Debouncing Search Input]
**Learning:** The frontend filters the genre list synchronously on every keystroke (`oninput="filterAndRenderGenres(this.value)"`), which can cause main thread blocking and jank when dealing with hundreds or thousands of genres.
**Action:** Implement debouncing for search input handlers to delay the filtering logic until the user pauses typing. This is a classic frontend performance optimization that is simple to add and measurably improves responsiveness.
## 2024-05-07 - [Debouncing Template Inputs]
**Learning:** The frontend updates playlist and description templates synchronously on every keystroke (`oninput="updatePlaylistTemplate(this.value)"`), which causes main thread blocking and unnecessary localStorage writes.
**Action:** Implement debouncing for template input handlers to delay the updates until the user pauses typing. This is a classic frontend performance optimization that prevents jank and excessive IO operations.
## 2024-05-08 - [Interleaving JSON.parse with KV fetches]
**Learning:** Sequential processing of `Promise.all` results for KV fetches causes a large synchronous parsing block and delays CPU-bound work until all I/O is finished. By moving `JSON.parse` and data transformations directly into the async `map` closure, parsing can execute as soon as each individual KV read completes, reducing peak memory usage and overall wall-clock time.
**Action:** Always interleave parsing with async KV fetches by performing `JSON.parse` inside the `async` callback passed to `map`, rather than iterating over raw JSON results afterwards.
## 2024-05-14 - [Parallelizing KV Delete and List Operations]
**Learning:** Sequential `await kv.delete()` and `await kv.list()` operations inside `for...of` loops cause massive N+1 slowdowns in Cloudflare Workers, significantly increasing wall-clock time for API routes like `/admin/clear-cache` and `/admin`.
**Action:** Always wrap concurrent `kv` operations (e.g., `list`, `delete`, `get`, `put`) in `Promise.all()` to execute them in parallel, effectively binding total latency to the slowest single operation instead of the sum of all operations.

## 2026-05-23 - [Concurrent API requests with Promise.all]
**Learning:** Sequential await loops on independent API calls (like fetching tracks for multiple playlists or details for multiple artist batches) create unnecessary N+1 bottlenecks due to the accumulated network latency.
**Action:** Use `Promise.all()` to fire off independent requests concurrently. The network stack and Spotify API support concurrent outbound requests well within configured subrequest limits. Always catch individual request errors when mapping to ensure a single failure doesn't abort the entire batch.
