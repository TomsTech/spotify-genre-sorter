## 2024-05-04 - [Debouncing Search Input]
**Learning:** The frontend filters the genre list synchronously on every keystroke (`oninput="filterAndRenderGenres(this.value)"`), which can cause main thread blocking and jank when dealing with hundreds or thousands of genres.
**Action:** Implement debouncing for search input handlers to delay the filtering logic until the user pauses typing. This is a classic frontend performance optimization that is simple to add and measurably improves responsiveness.
## 2024-05-07 - [Debouncing Template Inputs]
**Learning:** The frontend updates playlist and description templates synchronously on every keystroke (`oninput="updatePlaylistTemplate(this.value)"`), which causes main thread blocking and unnecessary localStorage writes.
**Action:** Implement debouncing for template input handlers to delay the updates until the user pauses typing. This is a classic frontend performance optimization that prevents jank and excessive IO operations.
## 2024-05-08 - [Interleaving JSON.parse with KV fetches]
**Learning:** Sequential processing of `Promise.all` results for KV fetches causes a large synchronous parsing block and delays CPU-bound work until all I/O is finished. By moving `JSON.parse` and data transformations directly into the async `map` closure, parsing can execute as soon as each individual KV read completes, reducing peak memory usage and overall wall-clock time.
**Action:** Always interleave parsing with async KV fetches by performing `JSON.parse` inside the `async` callback passed to `map`, rather than iterating over raw JSON results afterwards.
## 2026-05-14 - [Micro-optimizations on Cold Paths]
**Learning:** Applying the "Interleave JSON.parse with KV fetches" pattern to small datasets (like the 20 Hall of Fame entries) or infrequently accessed cold paths (like admin routes) yields zero measurable performance improvement and introduces unnecessary code churn. These are considered forbidden micro-optimizations.
**Action:** Before applying a known performance pattern, measure the actual data size and path frequency to ensure the optimization will have a measurable, meaningful impact. If no hot path opportunity exists, abort the task.
